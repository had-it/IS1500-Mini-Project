<h1>Fractal Visualizer</h1>

The purpose of this project is to develop a two-dimensional graphical interactive visualization of the Mandelbrot set and Burning ship fractal by using the DTEK-V Board and I/O peripherals. The fractal visualization should be possible to scroll up, down, right, and left by manipulating the peripherals. It should also be possible to zoom in and zoom out. At the beginning of the program, the user will be able to choose a color palette for the image of the fractal. The main requirements of the project are along these lines:
- Moving the visualization horizontally and vertically
- Zooming in and out of the image
- A smooth and infinite zoom-in by pressing a button
- VGA to display graphics
- At least two dynamic color palettes

Some of the other features we might add if we have enough time are:
- Other equations to choose from, such as Julia set
- Joysticks for zooming and/or navigating 
- Colorful LED-lamp(-s) to mirror the color palette of the program
